# Let's Go Further â€” Practice Project

This repository contains my practice and follow-along project for the book **"Let's Go Further" by Alex Edwards**. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Go web application development by implementing the concepts, examples, and exercises presented in the book.

## About the Book

["Let's Go Further"](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/) is the sequel to _Let's Go_, focusing on advanced topics in Go web development. It covers areas such as:

- Authentication and authorization
- Middleware
- Security best practices
- Structuring and organizing large projects
- Background tasks and worker processes
- File uploads and downloads
- Advanced testing strategies

## Project Goals

- Reinforce concepts by coding along with the book.
- Experiment with variations and custom implementations.
- Build a working Go web application that incorporates advanced features and best practices.
- Document progress and insights for future reference.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.24+**
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code, GoLand)
- Basic understanding of Go (functions, structs, interfaces, etc.)
- Familiarity with the _Let's Go_ book or basic Go web development
